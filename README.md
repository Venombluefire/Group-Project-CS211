Project Requirements
With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from users and file database.

You and your partner will use everything you’ve learned over the past 12 weeks to create a real-world interactive c++ application. Here are the project requirements:

Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

Use file database ( in other words, demonstrate file input/output).
Use of C++ Inheritance and Polymorphism using virtual functions.
Use of Exceptions for error handling.
Code should be well-documented.
A walk through video to be provided for submission.
The presentation should include a UML class diagram showing class inheritance.
Presentation of the projects should include a demo of the working project.
All partners should equally participate.  There will be a peer review.
